PlateUp 🍽️

PlateUp is a simple full-stack college project built to demonstrate basic web development concepts using a MongoDB backend and an Express/JavaScript server. It’s intentionally minimal and focuses on functionality rather than polish.
This project was created as a learning exercise and uploaded publicly because there was no good reason not to.

Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express

Database: MongoDB

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Package Manager: npm

No frameworks, no overengineering, no magic.

What This Project Does

As of now, the website includes:

A home page

A recipe section with predefined recipes

A blog system

A MongoDB-backed admin/block page to manage blog content

A simple character picker feature
